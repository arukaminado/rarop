# rarop
Graphical ROP chain builder using radare2 and r2pipe.

This is WIP, standing on my TODO for a long time... It has been released just cause people is asking for it. So beware that it lacks many functionalities and some others such as import/export are not working.

## Setup
```
$ cd rarop/
$ npm install
```

## Usage
```
$ cd rarop/
$ bin/rarop /bin/true
```
Then point your browser to http://localhost:9091

## Kwown problems
* It will be slow as hell with big binaries
* export/import is not working
* Too many other problems
